This code implements a conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate label-conditioned MNIST images. In 5 points:

Initialization: Implements a conditional WGAN-GP with generator (transposed convolution) and discriminator (convolution), configured for GPU acceleration if available.

Preprocessing: Loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale images).

Training: Alternates between discriminator updates (with gradient penalty) and generator updates for improved stability.

Class Control: Generates specific digit classes (e.g., 0-2 via num_classes_show=3) using label embeddings.

Output: Periodically saves models and visual samples during training.

Optimized for training stability with WGAN-GP and class conditioning through label embeddings.
